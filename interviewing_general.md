## Interviewing guidelines 

#### General tips 

- Go three levels higher in volume for phone screen 
  - Minimizes filler words and nervousness
- Connection is key for interviews 
- Eye contact: hold eye contact for duration of thought; in silence, find another pair of eyes 
- Sit up straight 
  - Tip: put one foot in front of the other 

#### Personal Pitch 

1. How did you start in this industry 
2. What do you know? Skills + projects 
3. You + company ("hit the ground running")

- Story: beginning, middle, end 
- If they're hiring, they're probably behind 
- If you're rambling, shut it down 
- Keep it simple and to the point 
- Don't convey training as lack of experience – instead, "sharpening skills"
