# Training Plan 

## 2 Week 

### Daily WOD
- 15 min algorithm practice 
- 30 min taking notes on CS topic, working on personal project, or frontend masters challenge (time self) 
- 5 min commit and push everything 
- 10 min apply to positions or reply emails

### Knowledge Gaps 
- Algorithm Complexity 
- Sorting 
  - Why bubble-sort is no bueno 
  - Know details of two `n x log(n)` sorting algorithms (e.g. quicksort and merge sort)
- Hashtables 
  - How to implement one using only arrays 
- Trees 
  - Basic construction 
  - Traversal and manipulation algorithms 
  - Binary trees, n-ary trees, trie-trees 
  - Balanced binary trees (red/black tree, splay tree, or AVL tree)
  - Differences between BFS and DFS, between inorder, postorder, and preorder
- Graphs 
  - Objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list (pros and cons of each)
  - Traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS (conputational complexity, tradeoffs, implementation)
  - Bonus: Dikstra algorithm and A*
- Data structures and algorithms
  - traveling salesman, knapsack problem
  - What does NP-complete mean? 
- Mathematics 
  - Basic discrete math: counting problems, probability problems 
  - Combinatorics and probability 
  - n-choose-k problems 
- Languages 
  - Learn Python 
- [System design](http://research.google.com/pubs/DistributedSystemsandParallelComputing.html)
  - [Google File System](http://research.google.com/archive/gfs.html)
  - [Google Bigtable](http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html)
  - [Google MapReduce](http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html)\
- Testing 
  - What is TDD 
  - Test cases - not necessarily coding the tests, but planning what you would test 
  - Break your own code 
  - Organize test cases to catch all bugs 
  - Testing principles: security, scalability, reliability, performance, etc.
- Operating systems 
  - Processes, threads, concurrency issues 
  - Locks, mutexes, semaphores, monitors – how do they work 
  - How to avoid deadlock and livelock 
  - Resources required by processes or threads 
  - How context switching works, how it's initiated by OS and underlying hardware 
  - What is scheduling 
- Benchmarking 
- Storing on AWS 
- PostGRES vs mysql 
- How to deploy an application 
- Building an app from the ground up (no boilerplate shortcuts)

### Misc. Resources 
- Cracking the coding interview 
- Check saved emails for interviewing tips and tricks
